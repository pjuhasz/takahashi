syntax

- revise syntax so that image is only a single line, like this:
- .image filename [scale]

- add new .option or .set (single line)
- e.g .set background black

- custom header

- revise syntax so that instead of .gnuplot 
  a more general .script gnuplot can be used and it can have options?

- .include?

- simpler syntax for gradually revealed lines that translate to \uncover
* foo
* bar
* baz

- simpler syntax for tables?
* foo & bar
* baz & quux


implementation

- make it modular, configurable
- also configurable headers
- based on Makefile that takes care of most steps
- command "takahashi new name" would init a new presentation with .src, Makefile, git or hg
